# Overview
This is the overview of the project. Here, I will put the overview

# Getting started

## Software Environment
For this project, we are implementing our Movie Recommender App using Android Studio Hedgehog | 2023.1.1 Patch 2.

**NOTE: For testing our app, we used emulators with AT LEAST Android 13.0, since it seems that older versions struggle with certain
API things we do. We won't go over any API stuff in this demo, rather focusing on the Jetpack Compose things we created.**

**Dependencies:**

**NOTE: There aren't any separate installations you need for this project. Jetpack Compose is fully supported by Android Studio.
Additionally, some of these dependencies are for things that we won't go over with this demo, such as firebase dependencies**
